# pyturtlefoods

## Inspiration
PyTurtleFoods was designed by people who love to cook, but who aren't always creative in choosing what to cook. It solves the problem of deciding what to cook, leaving you to focus on the ingredients that you like, and even helping you to know some cool combinations of foods you like but you never knew you could mix together!

## What it does
PyTurtleFoods will allow you to store the information about the foods you have in your fridge and pantry, and then it gives you suggestions on what to cook with these things.

## How we built it
PyTurtleFoods at this point simply contains a backend API that yields recipes (FastAPI/Python), a database to store the foods(Python/SQL Alchemy/SQLite), and a frontend page in React.

## Challenges we ran into
Some of the challenging tasks we have are related to expanding the functionalities of the product: handling quantities, allowing categorization of recipes, and such.

## What's next for PyTurtle Foods
PyTurtleFoods will most likely be rebranded and launched as a mobile app, with some additional functionalities.
